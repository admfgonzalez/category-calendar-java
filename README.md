"Build a calendar where you can see the current full year, separated by months in columns of three but that these are collapsible to be able to see it from a phone, there must be a list of categories, these must initially be vacations and work, you must be able to add categories to this list and also to be able to eliminate them, the categories must be selectable and when selecting it and clicking on a day of this calendar, that day must be marked with the indicated category, in the case that the day already has a category it must indicate which has both categories, if I click again one day I must remove the category that is selected."
